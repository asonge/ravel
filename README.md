# Ravel

Ravel provides a set of CRDT's (Concurrent or Commutative Replicated Data Types) for Elixir, with a little more than inspiration from Basho's https://github.com/basho/riak_dt

## About the name
There's something perverted about making a simple CRDT library. That unravel means the same thing as ravel is just as perverse.
